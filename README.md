# reflectgui
Automatic GUI forms for editing Java classes 

This is a subset of a serialization and object editor form (GUI) generation framework written at Santa Cruz Games in late 2008 and early 2009 during the development of the Jakks Pacific Plug & Play "TV Games" *Tinker Bell and the Lost Tresture* and *Power Rangers: Force in Time*.  I acquired ownership of my contributions to these games in early 2011.
